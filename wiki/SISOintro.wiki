#summary Detailed description of SISO modules

= Introduction =

Soft Input Soft Output (SISO) modules project aims at creating a library of algorithms used in turbo receivers. A well known example of such algorithms is the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm. Several algorithms are implemented as methods of a C++ class using IT++ library.

Within the SISO class, the following SISO modules are implemented:

    * decoder for Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes
    * decoder for Non-recursive non-Systematic Convolutional (NSC) codes
    * equalizer for multipath channels (without and with precoding)
    * descrambler for Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) systems
    * Multi User Detectors (MUDs) for IDMA systems (without and with precoding)
    * demappers for Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems and Space Time (ST) BICM systems

The EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart of turbo receivers based on SISO modules can be obtained using the EXIT class.
