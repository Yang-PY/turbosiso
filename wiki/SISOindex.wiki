= Soft Input Soft Output modules for turbo reception =

== Description ==

 C++ class implementing Soft Input Soft Output (SISO) modules for turbo reception using [http://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/itpp/ IT++ library].

Within the *SISO class*, the following SISO modules are implemented:

  * decoder for Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes
  * decoder for Non-recursive non-Systematic Convolutional (NSC) codes
  * equalizer for multipath channels (without and with precoding)
  * descrambler for Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) systems
  * Multi User Detectors (MUDs) for IDMA systems (without and with precoding)
  * demappers for Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems and Space Time (ST) BICM systems

The EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#brink01convergence [11]] of turbo receivers based on SISO modules can be obtained using the *EXIT class*.

== Generic SISO module ==

 A generic SISO module has as inputs intrinsic and a priori informations and as outputs extrinsic informations [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#benedetto96soft [1]].

*Generic SISO module*

 The _intrinsic information of coded bits_ is defined as:

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_0.png]

where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_1.png] is the probability density of the received symbol (e.g. BPSK modulated), [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_2.png], knowing the coded bit, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_3.png].

The _a priori information of data bits_ is defined as:

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_4.png]

where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_5.png] is the a priori probability of the data bit, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_6.png]. The relationship between the data bits, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_7.png], and the coded bits, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_8.png], defines the coding algorithm (e.g. convolutional coding, multipath propagation, symbol mapping, space-time coding, etc.).

The _extrinsic information of coded bits_ is defined as:

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_9.png]

where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_10.png] is the Logarithm of Likelihood Ratio (LLR) of coded bits.

The _extrinsic information of data bits_ is defined as:

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_11.png]

where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_12.png] is the LLR of data bits.

Both LLRs, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_10.png] and [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_12.png], are computed using the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm or some simplified version of it.

At the last iteration of the turbo reception algorithm, data bits can be recovered from the LLR of data bits:

== Detailed description of SISO modules ==

 *- decoder for RSC codes*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_RSC.jpg]

*SISO RSC module*

 Decodes RSC codes of coding rate [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_14.png]. An adaptation of the MAP algorithm for RSC codes is used [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#pietrobon94simplification [2]]. Both versions, log MAP and max log MAP are implemented. The trellis describing the RSC code must begin in zero state. The trellis can end in zero state (tail bits must be added to input data bits of the RSC code) or in an unknown state (no tail bits needed).

When the BPSK modulated received symbols, [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_2.png], are fed to the SISO RSC module input, the intrinsic information of data and parity bits has the expression:

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_15.png]

, where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_16.png] is the variance of the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The sign minus in the above expression comes from the way the BPSK mapping is done: [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_17.png] and [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_18.png].

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pccc.wiki Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Codes].

*- decoder for NSC codes*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_NSC.jpg]

*SISO NSC module*

 Decodes NSC codes of coding rate [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_19.png], where [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_20.png] is the number of outputs of the NSC code. Optionally, a scrambler can be used at the NSC code output in order to lower the coding rate. In this case, the SISO NSC module is used for decoding both the NSC code and the scrambler. The MAP algorithm (log MAP and max log MAP) is used [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#bahl74optimal [3]]. The trellis must have the same properties as for the RSC codes.

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/sccc.wiki Serial Concatenated Convolutional Codes] or [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/idma.wiki Interleave Division Multiple Access].

*- equalizer for multipath channels*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_EQ.jpg]

*SISO equalizer module*

 The multipath channel is a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with real coefficients. The multipath channel is seen as a code of coding rate [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_21.png]. The channel order must be at least [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_22.png] ([http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_23.png] multipaths). The channel inputs are BPSK modulated symbols ([http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_17.png] and [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_18.png]).

In this case the general model of the SISO module is not followed and the received signal is directly used as one input of the SISO module (instead of the intrinsic information). The second input is represented by the a priori information of input symbols. There is a single output represented by the extrinsic information of input symbols.

A precoder can be used at the channel input in order to obtain a recursive equivalent channel. When a precoder is used, the channel order can be at least [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_24.png] (one path).

The MAP algorithm (log MAP and max log MAP) is implemented according to [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#koetter04turbo [4]]. The channel trellis must begin in zero state (that is the channel cases must be filled with [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_25.png]). The channel trellis can end in zero state or in an unknown state.

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/equalizer.wiki Turbo equalizer].

*- descrambler for IDMA systems*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_descr.jpg]

*SISO descrambler module*

 The scrambler is seen as a repetition code. A simplified version of the MAP algorithm is implemented [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#mahadevappa02mitigating [5]].

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/idma.wiki Interleave Division Multiple Access].

*- MUD for IDMA systems*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_MUD.jpg]

*SISO MUD module*

 The SISO MUD has as inputs the received signal and the a priori informations of emitted symbols from all users. The output of the SISO MUD is represented by the extrinsic informations of all users. Thus, in our numerical implementation, the a priori and extrinsic informations are matrices with rows corresponding to different users.

The multipath channels from all users are seen as a code with multiple inputs and single output (MISO). The channel inputs are BPSK modulated symbols ([http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_17.png] and [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_18.png]) and the channel coefficients are real numbers.

The following algorithms are implemented [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#mahadevappa02mitigating [5]], [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#liu04iterative [6]]:

  * max log MAP algorithm
  * Gaussian Chip Detector (GCD)
  * simplified GCD

When the max log MAP algorithm is used, the channel trellis must begin in zero state (that is the channel cases of each users must be filled with [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/form_25.png]) and can end in zero state or in an unknown state. When the GCD and the simplified GCD are used, a zero padding technique must be used in order to eliminate the interblock interference (a block is defined by the interleaver length) [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#wang00wireless [7]].

The max log MAP algorithm can be used when a precoder is used at each channel input, in order to obtain recursive equivalent channels.

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/idma.wiki Interleave Division Multiple Access].

*- demapper for BICM and ST-BICM*

[http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SISO_demapper.jpg]

*SISO demapper module*

 The SISO demapper has as inputs the received signal and the a priori information of data bits. Its output is represented by the extrinsic information of data bits.

The channel must be flat-fading, represented by a single complex attenuation at each time instant. The channel inputs are complex symbols from a Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) constellation. The constellation must be quadratic.

The SISO demapper for BICM implements the following algorithms [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#tonello00space [8]]:

  * log MAP algorithm
  * max log MAP algorithm

and in the SISO demapper for ST-BICM the following algorithms are implemented [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#cristea08turbo [9]]:

  * max log MAP algorithm adapted for ST block codes
  * max log MAP algorithm adapted for Alamouti code (much lower complexity than the max log MAP algorithm for ST block codes)
  * Gaussian Approximation (GA)
  * simplified GA
  * Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) Parallel Interferrence Canceller (PIC)
  * Zero Forcing (ZF) PIC

The ST block codes are implemented using the model proposed in [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#hassibi02high [10]] (see *STC class*). Further, all algorithms implemented in the SISO demapper for ST-BICM use an equivalent channel model with real coefficients including the ST block code and the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channel [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/index.html#hassibi02high [10]].

For an usage example see [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/bicm.wiki Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation] or [http://turbosiso.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/stbicm.wiki Space Time Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation].
