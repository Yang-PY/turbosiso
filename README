Note that IT++ library should be already installed. Both, release and debug versions
of the SISO shared library, are generated.

make install
The default installation path for the shared libraries is '/usr/local/lib'. Note 
that the header files remain into SISO folder.

Several examples are available into Turbo folder. Enter into this folder and
compile a given example with
make example_name
by replacing example_name with the desired example.

mexFiles folder contains MATLAB interfaces for all available SISO modules. Enter
into mexFiles folder and compile the mex files with:

to adjust compilation parameters to your needs (by default ACML library is used).
